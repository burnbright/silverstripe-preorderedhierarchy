The idea of this module is to introduce additional ordering fields to speed up hieratical data retrieval.

TODO:
 * Re-Ordering nodes
 * Adding nodes
 
 * Live vs Stage + roll back etc?
 
 * Handle the cases where a node should not be visible, and the children should not be visible.
		-This could be done by running a second query that excludes the range of values between the parent's LHS and RHS.
